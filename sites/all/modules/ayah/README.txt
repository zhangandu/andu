Readme file for the AYAH module for Drupal
---------------------------------------------

Installation:
  Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.

Dependencies:
  There are no dependencies on other Drupal modules, however the AYAH module 
  uses PHP CURL to validate the user so you need CURL enabled in your PHP 
  installation, see http://us3.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php

Configuration:
  The configuration page is at admin/user/ayah under the User management
  menu.  Here you can configure the AYAH module and enable challenges for 
  the desired forms.
